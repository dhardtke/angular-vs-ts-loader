# angular-vs-ts-loader
A comparison between the AngularCompilerPlugin@7 and ts-loader.

This repository contains 1000 stub components (located in `app/stubs` and generated by `util/create_stubs.py`) which will be lazy loaded during runtime.

**Notice**: Both configurations have the forked type checker enabled.

## Try it out
### webpack-dev-server
```
yarn run dev:ts-loader
yarn run dev:angular
```

### build
```
yarn run build:ts-loader
yarn run build:angular
```
